# Cyber Security Project
Azure ELK stack project

Linux scripts and ansible scripts that I've learned from my Cyber Security class 

Most of the scripts were used to configure cloud servers with different docker containers
The final setup was 4 servers running DVWA conatainers with a jump box and a server running ELK stack containers.
